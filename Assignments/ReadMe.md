## Introduction

This repository organizes and documents my learning journey in MLOps, combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. Each assignment reflects an incremental learning step, covering foundational to advanced MLOps workflows, tools, and processes.  

### Objectives
1. Build a strong foundation in **CI/CD pipelines**, **experiment tracking**, and **data versioning**.  
2. Develop advanced skills in **model experimentation**, **packaging**, and **deployment**.  
3. Gain proficiency in widely used MLOps tools, such as **MLflow**, **DVC**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**.
